    <h1>Notes On How To Make Nigerian Fried Rice:</h1>
<p>It’s ok to add a dash of cayenne pepper if you like some heat!</p>
<p>Don’t over boil your Rice before frying it, otherwise, you will end up with soggy fried rice.</p>
<p>Fried rice is best enjoyed when the Veggies remain crunchy, so don’t overcook your veggies.</p>
<p>I used mixed veggies which consist of Carrots, Sweet Peas, Sweet Corn, and Green Beans. However, vegetables like sweet bell peppers can also be used.</p>
<p>In order to achieve that nice coveted crisp, you will need to turn up the heat to high during the frying process and stir continuously as you allow the rice to heat up.</p>
<p>When making this Fried Rice, it is best to use Chicken stock or Turkey stock because of their mild taste. The beef stock should be avoided as it can overpower the taste of the fried rice.</p>
